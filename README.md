# Build_mouse_using_eyes
The main goal of this project is to develop a hands-free virtual mouse system that allows users to control the computer cursor using only their eye movements and blinks. This system is designed to assist physically challenged people who cannot use a traditional mouse and also demonstrates how computer vision and AI can be used in human.
